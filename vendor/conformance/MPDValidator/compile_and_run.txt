REQUIREMENTS
------------
JAVA >= 1.6.0 Update 17
Apache Ant

For compiling you need the JDK >= 1.6.0 Update 17


COMPILATION
-----------
For compiling the conformance software, you need to install or have Apache Ant.

After installing Apache Ant, you should run:

> ant

in the directory containing the build.xml.

Now ant will compile all necessary files. After the compilation is finished skip
to the Section EXECUTION.

If you get an error that JAVA_HOME is not set, you need to set it manually.

In Windows type:

> set JAVA_HOME=<pathtojdk>

For example, if you JDK ist installed in C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0, type:

> set JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0

In Linux use export, i.e.:

> export JAVA_HOME=<pathtojdk>


EXECUTION
---------
For executing the conformance software you need Apache ant. Switch to the directory
containing the build.xml. Now you are ready to run the conformance software.

For this use the following command:

> ant run -Dinput=<filetotest>

For example, if you have a file C:\DASH\test.mpd, you need to start the check using
the following command:

> ant run -Dinput=C:\DASH\test.mpd

Now ant will give you the outputs of the software. That is, if everything is valid
or if there are any error and which ones.
